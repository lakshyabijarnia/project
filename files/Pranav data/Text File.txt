Vehicle Description:
The vehicle used in this vibration analysis project is a battery-operated vehicle. This type of vehicle is powered by electric batteries and offers a clean and efficient means of transportation, which is increasingly popular in modern mobility solutions. The battery-operated vehicle typically features electric motors, a battery pack, and electronic control systems that manage the vehicle's performance and energy consumption.

Sensor Setup:
For the purpose of this analysis, accelerometers were mounted on the wheels of the vehicle to capture vibration data. The sensors were strategically placed to ensure accurate measurement of vibrations transmitted through the wheels as the vehicle moved.

Accelerometers: These sensors are designed to measure acceleration forces and were used to detect the vibrations experienced by the wheels. Typically, triaxial accelerometers were employed to capture vibrations in three dimensions (X, Y, and Z axes), providing a comprehensive view of the vibrational forces at play.
Mounting: The accelerometers were securely attached to the wheels to ensure stable and precise data collection. Proper mounting is crucial to avoid additional noise or erroneous data due to sensor movement or loose connections.
Road Conditions: The vehicle was driven on a semi-cemented road, which provides a varied surface texture and introduces different types of vibrational inputs to the vehicle. Semi-cemented roads are characterized by a mix of cement and other materials, often resulting in an uneven and rough surface. This type of road is ideal for vibration analysis as it subjects the vehicle to realistic and challenging conditions that reveal valuable insights into its vibrational behavior and structural integrity.
Data Acquisition Process:
The data acquisition process for obtaining vibration data from a vehicle involves several critical steps to ensure accurate and reliable measurements. Triaxial accelerometers were securely mounted on the vehicle's wheels, ensuring stable attachment to capture vibrations in all three dimensions (X, Y, and Z axes). The vehicle, a battery-operated model, was then driven on a semi-cemented road, providing a varied surface texture that introduces realistic vibrational inputs. The accelerometers convert the mechanical vibrations into electrical signals, which are then conditioned using amplifiers to boost the signal and filters to remove noise. These conditioned signals are fed into a Data Acquisition (DAQ) system, which digitizes the analog signals for further analysis. The DAQ system is configured with an appropriate sampling rate to capture the high-frequency components of the vibrations accurately. As the vehicle moves, the DAQ system continuously records the vibration data over a specified duration. This data is then stored in a suitable format, such as CSV or MAT files, for subsequent analysis. Using software tools like MATLAB, the recorded data is processed to convert the acceleration measurements into G levels and to perform frequency-domain analysis using techniques such as Power Spectral Density (PSD) estimation. This analysis helps identify dominant frequencies and other vibrational characteristics of the vehicle, providing valuable insights into its structural health and performance under different road conditions.

Signal Processing Techniques Used:
Several signal processing techniques are employed to ensure accurate analysis and meaningful insights. Initially, the raw acceleration data collected by the accelerometers is pre-processed to remove any noise or unwanted components, using filters such as low-pass, high-pass, or band-pass filters, depending on the specific requirements. Following noise reduction, the data is converted from the time domain to the frequency domain using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). This transformation allows for the identification of dominant frequencies and helps in understanding the spectral content of the vibration signal. Additionally, Power Spectral Density (PSD) estimation is performed to quantify how the power of the vibration signal is distributed across different frequencies. Techniques like Welch's method, which involves segmenting the data, applying a window function, and averaging the squared magnitudes of the Fourier transforms of these segments, are commonly used to obtain a more reliable PSD estimate. These frequency-domain analyses are crucial for identifying resonant frequencies, potential faults, and overall vibrational behavior of the vehicle. Furthermore, time-domain analysis may also be conducted to observe the variations in vibration intensity over time and to identify transient events or anomalies. By applying these signal processing techniques, the vibration data is thoroughly analyzed, providing comprehensive insights into the vehicle's performance and structural integrity.
